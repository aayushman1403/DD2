# Milk Quality Prediction Model

## Overview
This is a collaborative project which seeks to revolutionize  dairy farming interactions by providing vital information and ensuring transparency at Dairy centrein which this machine learning model project aims to predict the quality of milk based on various input features using machine learning techniques. The model predicts whether the milk is of high , medium or low quality based on factors such as fat content, odour, turbidity percentage, temperature, Ph level, taste and colour.

## Features
- Input features: 
  - Fat content
  - Turbidity percentage
  - Temperature
  - PH level
  - Taste
  - Odour level
  - Colour
- Target variable:
  - Grade (High,Medium or Low)

## Dataset
The model is trained on a dataset containing records of milk samples along with their corresponding quality labels. The dataset used for training and evaluation should be appropriately formatted and preprocessed.

## Model Architecture
The Milk Quality Prediction model is built using machine learning algorithm Gradient Boosting and has an accuracy of 84.33%

## Model Deployment on web page 
The model has been deployed on a web page utilizing the Flask framework to provide a user-friendly interface for accessing its functionalities.
